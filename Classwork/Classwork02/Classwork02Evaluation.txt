======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

In your TargetFile.java, you are calling the write method and
passing a variable that looks like a file name.  Although you are
actually doing the correct thing and passing the file CONTENT, the
variable name looks like you are writing out the file name.  Use
better naming conventions for this kind of thing....
