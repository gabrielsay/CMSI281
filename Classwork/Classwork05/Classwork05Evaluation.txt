Classwork05 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

You didn't rename the methods as instructed in the homework
assignment; they should be insert/remove or enqueue/dequeue
or some such.

The test coverage looks pretty good, but there is always
room for more -- you can never do too much testing.

scores:
=============================
IntLinkedList.java
   compiles                [1.00]
IntQueue.java
   changed to Queue name   [1.00]
   changed to enqueue()    [0.00]
   changed to dequeue()    [0.00]
IntQueueTester.java
   test coverage (3)       [3.00]
headers(3)                 [3.00]
code style                 [1.00]

total possible points      11 points

you got 9 out of 11 which is 81.82% which is a B-minus
