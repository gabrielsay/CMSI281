Homework03 Evaluation
======================

Pretty nice work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Remember that class names should start with an upper-case
letter.  That is a convention that all Java coders use.  It's
fine to start METHOD names with lower case, but not CLASS
names.  Don't forget that applies to the file name as well.

I know the book does it, but it's not good coding practice
to put long lines of //---------------------- between the
blocks.  Use JavaDoc style instead, like:

/**
 * method to give example
 * @param 
 * @param
 * @return
 * @throws
 */

 The Simon game works, but displays the letters in reverse
 order of what is expected.  They should be added to the END
 of the line, not the START of the line.  Also, it's a bit
 confusing to have to enter a space after every letter, but
 you DO tell the user to do that, so it's probably OK.

Total credit is 13 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 20 points for all three

you got 13 out of 13 which is 100% which is an A-plus
